```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Motivation

`R` packages that serve datasets come in several flavors. This post explores several aspects of these packages and their included datasets in order to:

 * Survey existing `R` datasets
 
 * Summarize best practices

Our primary objective is to increase dataset discoverability especially to increase the diversity of datasets used in `R` tutorials.

## Stats

### Package Stats

 * The number of packages on CRAN that include data

 * Does the `DESCRIPTION` contain `LazyData: true`?
 
 * How many authors are on packages that include data?

### Dataset Stats

 * How big is each dataset?

 * What topic are the datasets related to?
 
 * How are datasets licensed?

## Discussion

We did not look at datasets provided as raw files or on Bioconductor.

## Recommendations
